Ensure everything works. run the full test suite: 
'pnpm test'
'pnpm lint'
'pnpm build'

Summarize a brief report of the current state of the test suite and linter results. Enumerate each issue's error message, cause, and potential fix.

Assume every failure is your fault. For any failures, identify the root cause. Ensure you look at the immediate git history of the files involved, as important clues. Identify the shared root causes among test failures, if any.

Refer to test/AGENTS.md for testing + linting best practices.
